# JupyterLite Demo

This folder contains a [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) site for trying
[jupyterlab-diff](https://github.com/jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyterlab-diff) directly in the browser.

The site is built and deployed to GitHub Pages by the
[deploy workflow](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) on pushes to `main`.

## Build locally

The extension must be built first so its prebuilt lab extension is available:

```bash
# from the repository root
jlpm install
jlpm build
```

Then build the JupyterLite site:

```bash
cd demo
uv sync
uv run jupyter lite build
```

And serve it:

```bash
uv run python -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```
